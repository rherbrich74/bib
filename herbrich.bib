    abstract = {We present CRISP (COVID-19 Risk Score Prediction), a probabilistic graphical model for COVID-19 infection spread through a population based on the SEIR model where we assume access to (1) mutual contacts between pairs of individuals across time across various channels (e.g., Bluetooth contact traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, exposure and immunity tests. Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed, infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the reproduction factor R0 and exhibits population-level infectiousness and recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy measures. Moreover, the algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19 infection spread based on individual-level contact data; most epidemic models are macro-level models that reason over entire populations.},

    abstract = {Online advertising allows advertisers to only bid and pay for measurable user responses, such as clicks on ads. As a consequence, click prediction systems are central to most on-line advertising systems. With over 750 million daily active users and over 1 million active advertisers, predicting clicks on Facebook ads is a challenging machine learning task. In this paper we introduce a model which combines decision trees with logistic regression, outperforming either of these methods on its own by over 3%, an improvement with significant impact to the overall system performance. We then explore how  a number of fundamental parameters impact the final prediction performance of our system.  Not surprisingly, the most important thing is to have the right features: those capturing historical information about the user or ad dominate other types of features. Once we have the right features and the right model (decisions trees plus logistic regression), other factors play small roles (though even small improvements are important at scale). Picking the optimal handling for data freshness, learning rate schema and data sampling improve the model slightly, though much less than adding a high-value feature,  or picking the right model to begin with.},

While such technology is critical for helping us combat the overload of information we face, in many cases, we may not even realize that our results are being tailored to our personal tastes and preferences. Worse yet, when such a system makes a mistake, we have little recourse to correct it. In this work, we propose a framework for addressing this problem by developing a new user-interpretable feature set upon which to base personalized recommendations. These features, which we call badges, represent fundamental traits of users (e.g., “vegetarian” or “Apple fanboy”) inferred by modeling the interplay between a user’s behavior and self-reported identity. Specifically, we consider the microblogging site Twitter, where users provide short descriptions of themselves in their profiles, as well as perform actions such as tweeting and retweeting. Our approach is based on the insight that we can define badges using high precision, low recall rules (e.g., “Twitter profile contains the phrase ‘Apple fanboy”’), and with enough data, generalize to other users by observing shared behavior. We develop a fully Bayesian, generative model that describes this interaction, while allowing us to avoid the pitfalls associated with having positive-only data. Experiments on real Twitter data demonstrate the effectiveness of our model at capturing rich and interpretable user traits that can be used to provide transparency for personalization.},

This creates a feedback loop: as long as the low-cost way to interact with the service is through the recommender, the recommender will only ever see behavioral data on the items it chooses. This process can lead to hidden biases, as it effectively limits how much information the recommender system will ever see.  On the other hand, there is a cost to making exploratory recommendations, as they should, myopically, be worse than the best bets of a recommendation system.

We introduce an expressive graph-based language for extracting features from such knowledge bases and a theoretical framework for constructing feature vectors from the extracted features. Our experimental evaluation on different learning scenarios provides evidence that the features derived through our framework can considerably improve the prediction accuracy, especially when the labeled data at hand is sparse.},

Most importantly, a principled model for exploiting user feedback to learn the truth values of statements in the knowledge base would be a major step forward in addressing the issue of knowledge base curation. We present a family of probabilistic graphical models that builds on user feedback and logical inference rules derived from the popular Semantic-Web formalism of RDFS.

We propose a two-step strategy to solve this problem. The first step follows an active learning strategy that enables the selection of tweets for which a label would be most useful; the selected tweet is then forwarded to Amazon Mechanical Turk where it is labeled by multiple users.

The Matchbox system makes use of content information in the form of user and item meta data in combination with collaborative filtering information from previous user behavior in order to predict the value of an item for a user. Users and items are represented by feature vectors which are mapped into a low-dimensional trait space in which similarity is measured in terms of inner products. The model can be trained from different types of feedback in order to learn user-item preferences. Here we present three alternatives: direct observation of an absolute rating each user gives to some items, observation of a binary preference (like/ don't like) and observation of a set of ordinal ratings on a userspecific scale. Efficient inference is achieved by approximate message passing involving a combination of Expectation Propagation (EP) and Variational Message Passing. We also include a dynamics model which allows an item's popularity, a user's taste or a user's personal rating scale to drift over time. By using Assumed-Density Filtering (ADF) for training, the model requires only a single pass through the training data. This is an on-line learning algorithm capable of incrementally taking account of new data so the system can immediately reflect the latest user preferences. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on the MovieLens and Netflix data sets consisting of approximately 1,000,000 and 100,000,000 ratings respectively. This demonstrates that training the model using the on-line ADF approach yields state-of-the-art performance with the option of improving performance further if computational resources are available by performing multiple EP passes over the training data.},

    abstract = {We extend the Bayesian skill rating system TrueSkill to infer entire time series of skills of players by smoothing through time instead of filtering. The skill of each participating player, say, every year is represented by a latent skill variable which is affected by the relevant game outcomes that year, and coupled with the skill variables of the previous and subsequent year. Inference in the resulting factor graph is carried out by approximate message passing (EP) along the time series of skills. As before the system tracks the uncertainty about player skills, explicitly models draws, can deal with any number of competing entities and can infer individual skills from team results. We extend the system to estimate player-specific draw margins. Based on these models we present an analysis of the skill curves of important players in the history of chess over the past 150 years. Results include plots of players' lifetime skill development as well as the ability to compare the skills of different players across time. Our results indicate that a) the overall playing strength has increased over the past 150 years, and b) that modelling a player's ability to force a draw provides significantly better predictive power.},

The AUC is a different term than the error rate used for evaluation in classification problems; consequently, existing generalization bounds for the classification error rate cannot be used to draw conclusions about the AUC. In this paper, we define the expected accuracy of a ranking function (analogous to the expected error rate of a classification function), and derive distribution-free probabilistic bounds on the deviation of the empirical AUC of a ranking function (observed on a finite data sequence) from its expected accuracy. We derive both a large deviation bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a test sequence, and a uniform convergence bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a learned ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a training sequence. Our uniform convergence bound is expressed in terms of a new set of combinatorial parameters that we term the bipartite rank-shatter coefficients; these play the same role in our result as do the standard VC-dimension related shatter coefficients (also known as the growth function) in uniform convergence results for the classification error rate. A comparison of our result with a recent uniform convergence result derived by Freund et al. (2003) for a quantity closely related to the AUC shows that the bound provided by our result can be considerably tighter.},

We provide bounds on the prediction error of classifiers returned by mistakedriven online learning algorithms by interpreting mistake bounds as bounds on the size of the respective compression scheme of the algorithm. This leads to a bound on the prediction error of perceptron solutions that depends on the margin a support vector machine would achieve on the same training sample. Furthermore, using the property of compression we derive bounds on the average prediction error of kernel classifiers in the PAC-Bayesian framework.

Dependent random variables can result in a COCO which is arbitrarily close to zero when the source densities are highly non-smooth. All current kernel-based independence tests share this behaviour.

In contrast to classical VC analysis - where no single classifier within version space is singled out on grounds of a generalisation error bound - the data dependent structural risk minimisation framework suggests that there exists one particular classifier that is to be preferred because it minimises the generalisation error bound. This is usually taken to provide a theoretical justification for learning algorithms such as the well known support vector machine. A reinterpretation of a recent PAC-Bayesian result, however, reveals that given a suitably chosen hypothesis space there exists a large fraction of classifiers with small generalisation error although we cannot readily identify them for a specific learning task. In the particular case of linear classifiers we show that classifiers found by the classical perceptron algorithm have guarantees bounded by the size of version space. These results are complemented with an empirical study for kernel classifiers on the task of handwritten digit recognition which demonstrates that even classifiers with a small margin may exhibit excellent generalisation. In order to perform this analysis we introduce the kernel Gibbs sampler - an algorithm which can be used to sample consistent kernel classifiers.},

The result is obtained in a PAC-Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound, which was developed in the luckiness framework, and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and â€” for maximum margins â€” to a vanishing complexity term. In contrast to previous results, however, the new bound does depend on the dimensionality of feature space. The analysis shows that the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the fraction of hypothesis space consistent with the training sample. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal with respect to the new bound only if the feature vectors in the training sample are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only. Numerical simulations support this recommendation and demonstrate that the new error bound can be used for the purpose of model selection.},

In this paper, motivated by the luckiness framework of Shawe-Taylor et al.

The main difference to previous approaches lies in the complexity measure; rather than covering all hypotheses in a given hypothesis space it is only necessary to cover the functions which could have been learned using the fixed learning algorithm. We show how the resulting framework relates to the VC, luckiness and compression frameworks. Finally, we present an application of this framework to the maximum margin algorithm for linear classifiers which results in a bound that exploits the margin, the sparsity of the resultant weight vector, and the degree of clustering of the training data in feature space.},

In this paper we study this algorithm and a new variant: the perceptron algorithm with uneven margins, tailored for document categorisation problems (i.e. problems where classes are highly unbalanced and performance depends on the ranking of patterns). We discuss the interest of these algorithms from a theoretical point of view, provide a generalisation of Novikoff's theorem for uneven margins, give a geometrically description of these algorithms and show experimentally that both algorithms yield equal or better performances than support vector machines, while reducing training time and sparsity, in classification (USPS) and document categorisation (Reuters) problems.},

    abstract = {Kernel-classifiers comprise a powerful class of non-linear decision functions for binary classification. The support vector machine is an example of a learning algorithm for kernel classifiers that singles out the consistent classifier with the largest margin, i.e. minimal real-valued output on the training sample, within the set of consistent hypotheses, the so-called version space. We suggest the Bayes point machine as a well-founded improvement which approximates the Bayes-optimal decision by the centre of mass of version space. We present two algorithms to stochastically approximate the centre of mass of version space: a billiard sampling algorithm and a sampling algorithm based on the well known perceptron algorithm. It is shown how both algorithms can be extended to allow for soft-boundaries in order to admit training errors. Experimentally, we find that --- for the zero training error case --- Bayes point machines consistently outperform support vector machines on both surrogate data and real-world benchmark data sets. In the soft-boundary/soft-margin case, the improvement over support vector machines is shown to be reduced. Finally, we demonstrate that the real-valued output of single Bayes points on novel test points is a valid confidence measure and leads to a steady decrease in generalisation error when used as a rejection criterion.},

    abstract = {The concept of averaging over classifiers is fundamental to the Bayesian analysis of learning. Based on this viewpoint, it has recently been demonstrated for linear classifiers that the centre of mass of version space (the set of all classifiers consistent with the training set) - also known as the Bayes point - exhibits excellent generalisation abilities. However, the billiard algorithm as presented in [Herbrich et al., 2000] is restricted to small sample size because it requires O(m*m) of memory and O(N*m*m) computational steps where m is the number of training patterns and N is the number of random draws from the posterior distribution. In this paper we present a method based on the simple perceptron learning algorithm which allows to overcome this algorithmic drawback. The method is algorithmically simple and is easily extended to the multi-class case. We present experimental results on the MNIST data set of handwritten digits which show that Bayes Point Machines are competitive with the current world champion, the support vector machine. In addition, the computational complexity of BPMs can be tuned by varying the number of samples from the posterior. Finally, rejecting test points on the basis of their (approximative) posterior probability leads to a rapid decrease in generalisation error, e.g. 0.1\% generalisation error for a given rejection rate of 10\%.},

The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets.},

Hence, transduction is a less ambitious task than induction which aims at inferring a functional dependency on the whole of input space. As a consequence, however, transduction provides a confidence measure on single predictions rather than classifiers, a feature particularly important for risk-sensitive applications. We consider the case of binary classification by linear discriminant functions (perceptrons) in kernel space. From the transductive point of view, the infinite number of perceptrons is boiled down to a finite number of equivalence classes on the working sample each of which corresponds to a polyhedron in parameter space. In the Bayesian spirit the posteriori probability of a labelling of the working sample is determined as the ratio between the volume of the corresponding polyhedron and the volume of version space. Then the maximum posteriori scheme recommends to choose the labelling of maximum volume. We suggest to sample version space by an ergodic billiard in kernel space. Experimental results on real world data indicate that Bayesian Transduction compares favourably to the well-known Support Vector Machine, in particular if the posteriori probability of labellings is used as a confidence measure to exclude test points of low confidence.},

However, since the sample size required for supervised learning grows exponentially in the number of features it is not feasible to learn a segmentation procedure from a large amount of possible filters. But we argue that automatic model selection methods are able to select a region model in terms of some filters.},

    abstract = {In order to rank the performance of machine learning algorithms, many researchs conduct experiments on benchmark datasets. Since most learning algorithms have domain-specific parameters, it is a popular custom to adapt these parameters to obtain a minimal error rate on the test set. The same rate is used to rank the algorithm which causes an optimistic bias. We quantify this bias, showing in particular that an algorithm with more parameters will probably be ranked higher than an equally good algorithm with fewer parameters. We demonstrate this result, showing the number of parameters and trials required in order to pretend to outperform C4.5 or FOIL, respectively, for various benchmark problems. We then describe how unbiased ranking experiments should be conducted.},

    abstract = {The $\theta$-subsumption problem is crucial to the efficiency of ILP learning systems. We discuss two $\theta$-subsumption algorithms based on strategies for preselecting suitable matching literals. The class of clauses, for which subsumption becomes polynomial, is a superset of the deterministic clauses. We further map the general problem of $\theta$-subsumption to a certain problem of finding a clique of fixed size in a graph, and in return show that a specialization of the pruning strategy of the Carraghan and Pardalos clique algorithm provides a dramatic reduction of the subsumption search space. We also present empirical results for the mesh design data set.},
