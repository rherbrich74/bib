	abstract = {A precise lithium-ion battery model is required to specify their appropriateness for different applications and to study their dynamic behavior. In addition, it is important to design an efficient battery system for power applications. In this investigation, a second-order equivalent electrical circuit battery model, which is the most conventional method of characterizing the behavior of a lithium-ion battery, was developed. The current pulse procedure was employed for parameterization of the model. The construction of the model was described in detail, and a battery model for a 13 Ah lithium titanate oxide battery cell was demonstrated. Comprehensive characterization experiments were accomplished for an extensive range of operating situations. The outcomes were employed to parameterize the suggested dynamic model of the lithium titanate oxide battery cell. The simulation outcomes were compared to the laboratory measurements. In addition, the proposed lithium-ion battery model was validated. The recommended model was assessed, and the proposed model was able to anticipate precisely the current and voltage performance.},

@article{AndMeiSte2011i,
	abstract = {A common way to model lithium-ion batteries is to apply equivalent circuit (EC) models. In this work two different EC models are build up and parameterized for a commercial 6.5 Ah high-power lithium-ion cell. Measured impedance spectroscopy data depending on temperature and state of charge (SOC) are used for parameter estimation. The first EC model consists of an ohmic resistor (R), an inductor (L) and three RC-elements (a parallel connection of a capacitor (C) and a resistor). The second EC model consists of one R, one L, two Zarc elements and a Warburg element. The estimated parameters were used to develop two empirical electrical cell models which are able to predict the voltage of the cells depending on current, temperature and SOC. Hereby the internal cell resistance Ri is based on the EC models and a Butler--Volmer adjustment. Both approaches were validated by current profiles, which cover typical automotive applications to prove the model performance at low temperatures and high dynamic operation. An accurate voltage prediction could be realized with both EC models. The second, more complex, model is able to predict cell voltage more precisely, but at the expense of up to four times higher computational effort.},

@article{KooWij2021d,
	abstract = {This article presents a forecasting model of data center electricity needs based on understanding usage growth and we conclude that this growth is not fully compensated by efficiency gains of data center technological innovations. We predict a combined growth of data center electricity needs of 286 TWh in 2016 until about 321 TWh in 2030, if all currently known growth factors remain the same. We next run simulations for the end of Moore's law and the growth of industrial Internet of Things (IoT). The end of Moore's law results in about 658 TWh for 2030 and an increase of the share of global data center electricity consumption from about 1.15% in 2016 to 1.86% in 2030. A rise of the Industrial IoT may result into total energy consumption of about 364 TWh (about 1.03%) in 2030. Moore's law and IoT combined cause data center energy needs going up to 752 TWh in 2030, and about 2.13% of global electricity available. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that the future impact of the data centers' electricity consumption is vulnerable to behavioral usage trends, since the 95% confidence interval of [343, 1031] TWh is relatively wide. Our forecasts, however, exclude the energy needs of mobile devices, edge and fog computing. We offer a system dynamic model and simulation input data selected from the existing literature for replicating this study and applying alternative parameters to it. We further suggest multiple research directions on usage impact on data center energy consumption.},
